We are planning on developing an application that will allow Dartmouth students to match up with roommates or add to roommate groups during offterms in the cities that they will live in. For example, imagine having an Airbnb for 3, when one of your roommates drops out of the group, citing irreconcilable living style difference (he likes to take long showers in the morning and you hate that). You, like most students, probably prefer to live with someone from you own college. Although not a guarantee of friendship, there is a level of comfort associated with living with a classmate from your school. We hope to create and Airbnb/Craiglists/Facebook amalgamation.

## Architecture

TODO:  descriptions of code organization and tools and libraries used
We plan on using some of the same tools we used in the later labs. We will use React and Redux, and also incorporate an interactive map if possible, in order to create a roommate matching interface. We will use MongoDB and Mongoose for the backend, as well as any other tools we find useful as we come across them.
